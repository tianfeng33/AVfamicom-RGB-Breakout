# AVfamicom-RGB-Breakout
This is a simple break out board designed to be used with Tim Worthingtons's NES RGB
The goal of this was to create a board where you would be able to plug in headers and easily connect to the nesrgb without having to solder directly to the din or to flip the board over. 
Thanks to Mobius for help with the measurments.
